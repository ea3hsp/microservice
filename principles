business logic service
Requests and responses
Endpoints
Transports

Build the layers of the service "onion" from the inside out. First, the
business logic service; then, the set of endpoints that wrap the service;
and finally, a series of concrete transport adapters. The adapters, like
the HTTP handler or the gRPC server, are the bridge between Go kit and
the interfaces that the transports expect.
